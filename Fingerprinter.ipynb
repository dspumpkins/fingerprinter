        "#What is this?\n",
        "This is a computer program that takes the \"fingerprint\" of a text file that you give it. The purpose is to make it easier to spot tampering. A tiny change in the text will cause the fingerprint to be obviously different.\n",
        "\n",
        "#How do I use this on a desktop?\n",
        "1. You are probably reading this on the `colab.research.google.com` website or the `github.com` website. In the former case, skip directly to step 2. In the latter case, if you are unfamiliar with a webpage like this, the easiest thing to do is click this link and then proceed to step 2:\n",
        "https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1nPrdk4w_sl6zjJVWP-DS7HKIyuIth6KN?usp=sharing\n",
        "If that doesn't work, the next-easiest thing to do is signup for Google Colab, perhaps do one of the tutorials, paste the code below into a blank notebook, and then proceed to step 2. (Also note - the above link is for the most recent version; see below for previous versions.)\n",
        "2. Save the document that you want to fingerprint as a .txt file - for example in Google Docs, go to File > Download > Plain text (.txt)\n",
        "3. Upload your .txt file by clicking the folder icon to the left, then the upload icon.  \n",
        "4. Hover your mouse just to the left of the cell containing \"!pip install...\" You should see a \"play\" icon. Click this. Some setup happens automatically for a couple of minutes.\n",
        "5. Do the same thing in the next cell. Nothing will happen except you should see a little green check mark in a few seconds. This is more automatic setup.\n",
        "6. In the next cell, set `input_path` to the name of the file you uploaded.\n",
        "7. Now click the play icon to the left of the cell you just edited.\n",
        "8. You should see a message containing the fingerprint.\n",
        "9. Copy-paste that output message into the end of your document.\n",
        "10. If you make revisions to your document, don't worry about removing the fingerprint before repeating the above steps - however, the result of this script will change, so you'll need to overwrite the old fingerprint with the updated one.\n",
        "\n",
        "#What about a mobile device?\n",
        "1. It is basically the same as above, but more awkward. Chrome on an ipad should work ok.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Is it perfect?\n",
        "No. Certain text changes will not cause the fingerprint to change; this is on purpose, because sometimes web browsers make small changes when copy-pasting text between various apps, and we do not want those to confuse us. This script ignores the numbers in numbered lists. It ignores the tilde character and various other special characters. So don't use this to compare source code. Plus whatever bugs I'm unaware of. But as long as we run the same version of the script, we'll get the same answer for the same input.\n",
        "\n",
        "#What if I want to run my text through an earlier version of this program?\n",
        "Excellent question! We shouldn't be surprised if different versions (e.g. Fingerprinter.ipynb version 1.0 versus 1.1) give different fingerprints for the same input text. This means that if you try to verify a policy's fingerprint and it does not match the fingerprint it claims it has, or it does not match the fingerprint of the corresponding draft, one of the first things to check is that you are using the same version of Fingerprinter.ipynb that was used to make the fingerprint being claimed at the end of the document or in the vote log.
